CURRENCY CONVERSION LOGIC.

The system uses hardcoded exchange rates for currency conversion.
Default currency: GBP (Â£)
Users choosing USD or EUR have their initial balance converted from 750 GBP using:

EXCHANGE_RATES = {
    ('GBP', 'EUR'): 1.16,
    ('GBP', 'USD'): 1.38,
    ('EUR', 'GBP'): 0.86,
    ('EUR', 'USD'): 1.18,
    ('USD', 'GBP'): 0.72,
    ('USD', 'EUR'): 0.85,
}
Transactions between different currencies are converted accordingly.

SECURITY FEATURES.

1.Authentication & Authorization (Django user model, login/logout).
2.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection (SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True).
3.Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection (CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True).
4.Clickjacking Protection (X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY').
5.SQL Injection Prevention (ORM queries instead of raw SQL).
